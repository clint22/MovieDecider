# MovieDecider
Movie Decider is a sample application that I developed as part of my Kotlin Android for beginners course. This project is all about starting with the basics of Android development 
and Kotlin in general. We are working on only a few lines of codes. But, I hope this repo and it's corresponding blog posts will help you to kick start your Android learning.
